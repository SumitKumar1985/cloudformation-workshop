- About

This workshop was first run as a series of consecutive weekly meetups at ["We Love AWS CloudFormation!"](https://www.meetup.com/We-love-AWS-CloudFormation/) beginning 28th November 2017

- Format
  - We use the [documentation for CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudformation/) (the User Guide) as a reference, and walk through it. 
  - As we go, we clarify aspects of it, we write templates and deploy stacks, and observe CloudFormation in action. 
  - See the [bookmarks](notes/bookmarks.md) for highlighted text excerpts from the user guide.
